In the English Civil War, the majority of Londoners supported the Parliamentary cause. After an initial advance by the Royalists in 1642, culminating in the battles of Brentford and Turnham Green, London was surrounded by a defensive perimeter wall known as the Lines of Communication. The lines were built by up to 20,000 people, and were completed in under two months.[68] The fortifications failed their only test when the New Model Army entered London in 1647,[69] and they were levelled by Parliament the same year.[70]


The Great Fire of London destroyed many parts of the city in 1666.
London was plagued by disease in the early 17th century,[71] culminating in the Great Plague of 1665â€“1666, which killed up to 100,000 people, or a fifth of the population.[71]

The Great Fire of London broke out in 1666 in Pudding Lane in the city and quickly swept through the wooden buildings.[72] Rebuilding took over ten years and was supervised by polymath Robert Hooke.[73] In 1708 Christopher Wren's masterpiece, St Paul's Cathedral, was completed. During the Georgian era, new districts such as Mayfair were formed in the west; new bridges over the Thames encouraged development in South London. In the east, the Port of London expanded downstream. London's development as an international financial centre matured for much of the 18th century.[74]

In 1762, George III acquired Buckingham House, which was enlarged over the next 75 years. During the 18th century, London was said to be dogged by crime,[75] and the Bow Street Runners were established in 1750 as a professional police force.[76] Epidemics during the 1720s and 30s saw most children born in the city die before reaching their fifth birthday.[77]

Coffee-houses became a popular place to debate ideas, as growing literacy and development of the printing press made news widely available, with Fleet Street becoming the centre of the British press. The invasion of Amsterdam by Napoleonic armies led many financiers to relocate to London and the first London international issue was arranged in 1817. Around the same time, the Royal Navy became the world's leading war fleet, acting as a major deterrent to potential economic adversaries. The repeal of the Corn Laws in 1846 was specifically aimed at weakening Dutch economic power. London then overtook Amsterdam as the leading international financial centre.[78]
